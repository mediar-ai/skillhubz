# Canvas Design

Create beautiful visual art in .png and .pdf documents using design philosophy. Generate posters, artwork, and static visual pieces with museum-quality craftsmanship.

## Prerequisites

- Image manipulation library (PIL/Pillow for Python)
- PDF generation capability
- Understanding of design principles

## Instructions

1. **Create a Design Philosophy**
   - Name the movement (1-2 words): "Brutalist Joy", "Chromatic Silence"
   - Define visual expression through form, space, color, composition
   - Emphasize: minimal text, spatial expression, artistic freedom

2. **Philosophy Examples**
   - "Concrete Poetry": Massive color blocks, sculptural typography
   - "Chromatic Language": Color zones create meaning, minimal labels
   - "Analog Meditation": Paper grain, vast negative space, photography
   - "Geometric Silence": Grid-based precision, bold photography

3. **Design Principles**
   - Text as visual element: sparse, essential-only, integrated
   - Spatial expression: ideas through space, form, color
   - Expert craftsmanship: appears labored over with care

4. **Canvas Creation**
   - Use repeating patterns and perfect shapes
   - Treat design as scientific observation - dense accumulation of marks
   - Add sparse, clinical typography
   - Use limited, cohesive color palette

5. **Quality Standards**
   - Nothing overlaps unintentionally
   - All elements contained within canvas with proper margins
   - Museum/magazine quality execution
   - Every detail refined meticulously

## Error Handling

- If fonts unavailable, search canvas-fonts directory
- Ensure text has breathing room and clear separation
- Check composition balance before finalizing

## Notes

- Output: Single .pdf or .png file alongside .md philosophy file
- Multi-page option: Create additional pages as variations
- Typography: Make fonts part of the art itself
